Hi! 

If you're reading this, I hope you're impressed with version 2.0!
In version 2.1 I plan to add a couple new features that I feel I missed in release 2.0:

UI changes:
1) Add the option to load different .env files (this was an option originally and I totally missed it on this release)
2) Add the option to pause and resume chat scroll on main window at rhe press of a button (it can be annoying)
3) Fix chat scroll so that it automatically scrolls to latest messages unless scroll is paused
4) Add trigger event displays for things like bot raid detection, follow triggers, and general command triggers. (colours maybe?)

Fixes and tweaks:
1) Tweak bot recognition slightly so that coincidental matches are no longer detected as possible bots. This doesn't happen often but still can happen so I will try my best to correct it.
2) Fix logging so it looks a bit cleaner. Overall it's a mess right now even though I tried my best a month ago when I created the logging feature XD
3) Fix main screen display so that it doesn't all look the same (maybe colour variation)

Extras:
1) Linux support? (Been trying for a while, almost there XD)
2) More UI controls, maybe a light theme toggle?
3) Support discord? Tbh I might just create a discord in general and have a section of it devoted to this.

Welp, that's it for this update. See yall in v2.1 and its update log XD
Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
