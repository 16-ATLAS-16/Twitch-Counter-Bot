Hi! 

If you're reading this you visit this repo rather often.
Thank you for sticking around, I'm still rather new to this I won't lie.

Anyways, this file from now on will contain all the planned updates and improvements in the next update of the bot.

Starting with v2.0.0 , the console window will no longer be around to confuse yall.
Instead, there will be a UI for both the setup and main cycle that will contain all the info you need to successfully run the bot!

Coming with the UI will also be a possible linux release which will have the same features, but yknow, on linux. 

Last but not least, there will be some extra options that are already present in the code but aren't official. These will help moderators on mobile devices manage twitch better from your chat. (We all know twitch won't add mod view to mobile)



That said, I'd like to thank you once again for sticking with me through this journey. I'll try to include a discord for general help and chatting soon too, that way yall can recommend stuff directly and I can add it (uless you wanna code it yourself idk XD)

Anyways, that's it for this update. It's what, 11PM now? Think I'll go watch twitch and see what else I can toss in for later.
